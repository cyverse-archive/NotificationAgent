# Notification Agent

This service accepts either arbitrary notification requests or callback
notifications from the OSM about job status changes and provides endpoints for
the Discovery Environment that are used to look up the notifications for the
current user. It also triggers the emails that are sent when e-mail
notifications are requested.

## Overview

The notification agent provides one endpoint that is designed to accept
arbitrary notification requests from arbitrary sources, one endpoint that is
designed to accept incoming job status updates from the OSM and three endpoints
that are designed to accept requests from the Discovery Environment. The
endpoint that accepts arbitrary notification requests is `/notification`, which
accepts JSON request bodies in the following format:

```json
{
    "type": "some_notification_type",
    "user": "some_user_name",
    "subject": "some notification subject",
    "message": "some message text",
    "email": true,
    "email_template": "some_email_template_name",
    "payload": {
        "email_address": "some@email.address"
    }
}
```

The `type`, `user` and `subject` fields are all required. Failure to include any
of these fields in the request will cause the service to return an error
response. The `message` field is optional and will default to the value of the
`subject` field if it's not provided. The `email` field contains a flag
indicating whether or not an e-mail message should be sent. This field is
optional and defaults to `false` if it's not provided. The `email_template`
field is required if an e-mail is requested and must contain the name of an
e-mail template that is known to the iPlant e-mail service. Failure to include
the name of a valid e-mail template in this field will result in the e-mail
message not being sent. The `payload` field is required if an e-mail message is
requested, and should contain the user's e-mail address along with any
parameters that are required by the e-mail template.

The endpoint that accepts updates from the OSM is `/job-status`, which accepts
updates in the same format that is used by the JEX and Panopticon to store job
status information in the OSM:

```json
{
    "type": "some_notification_type",
    "analysis_name" : "Some analysis name",
    "completion_date" : 1340390297000,
    "analysis_description" : "Some analysis description",
    "status" : "status-name",
    "output_dir" : "/path/to/job/output/directory/",
    "uuid" : "job-identifier",
    "condor-log-dir" : "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/",
    "working_dir" : "/path/to/job/working/directory/",
    "email" : "someuser@somewhere.com",
    "jobs" : {
       "step-name" : {
          "stderr" : "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/step-name-stderr",
          "log-file" : "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/step-name-log",
          "status" : "status-name",
          "exit-code" : "0",
          "environment" : "environment-variable-settings",
          "exit-by-signal" : "true-if-process-was-killed",
          "executable" : "/path/to/executable",
          "arguments" : "command-line-arguments",
          "id" : "step-name",
          "stdout" : "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/step-name-stdout"
       },
       ...
    },
    "request_type" : "request-type-name",
    "execution_target" : "execution-target-name",
    "user" : "someuser",
    "dag_id" : "directed-acyclic-graph-identifier",
    "notify" : "true-if-user-wants-notification-emails",
    "submission_date" : "submission-date-as-milliseconds-since-the-epoch",
    "workspace_id" : "numeric-workspace-identifier",
    "name" : "job-name",
    "description" : "",
    "now_date" : "timestamp-of-most-recent-update",
    "output_manifest" : ["list-of-output-files"],
    "nfs_base" : "/path/to/nfs/mountpoint/",
    "irods_base" : "/path/to/base/irods/directory",
    "analysis_id" : "analysis-identifier"
}
```

When a job status update is received, the notification agent first checks to see
if the overall job status has changed since the notification agent last received
an update for the job. If the overall status hasn't changed then the job status
update is ignored. Otherwise, the notification agent generates a notification,
stores it in its database, and forwards it to any configured recipients. (Note
that the recipients are not going to be used until server push is implemented.)
The notification is always in this format:

```json
{
    "workspaceId" : "numeric-workspace-identifier",
    "deleted" : "true-if-the-notification-has-been-deleted",
    "message" : {
       "timestamp" : "notification-generation-timestamp",
       "text" : "notification-text",
       "id" : "notification-uuid"
    },
    "outputDir" : "/path/to/job/output/directory/",
    "seen" : true,
    "payload" : {
       "analysis_name" : "Some analysis name",
       "status" : "status-name",
       "name" : "job-name",
       "startdate" : "start-date-as-millisecons-since-the-epoch",
       "description" : "",
       "enddate" : "timestamp-of-job-completion",
       "resultfolderid" : "/path/to/job/output/directory/",
       "action" : "job_status_change",
       "user" : "someuser",
       "id" : "job-identifier",
       "analysis_id" : "analysis-identifier"
    },
    "user" : "someuser",
    "type" : "analysis",
    "outputManifest" : ["list-of-output-files"]
}
```

Once a notification is stored in the database, it can be retrieved from the
notification agent using the `/messages` endpoint or the `/unseen-messages`
endpoint. These endpoints are roughly equivalent except that the latter can only
be used to list messages that haven't been seen by the user yet. The `/messages`
endpoint takes six query-string parameters:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Required/Optional</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>user</td>
            <td>The name of the user to retrieve notifications for.</td>
            <td>Required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>limit</td>
            <td>The maximum number of notifications to return at a time.</td>
            <td>Optional (there is no limit by default)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>offset</td>
            <td>The index of the starting message.</td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `0`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sortField</td>
            <td>
                The field to use when sorting messages. The values that are
                currently accepted for this field are: `date_created`,
                `timestamp` (which is, equivalent to `date_created`), `uuid` and
                `subject`.
            </td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `timestamp`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sortDir</td>
            <td>
                The sorting direction, which can be `asc` (ascending) or `desc`
                (descending).
            </td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `desc`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>filter</td>
            <td>
                Specifies the type of notification messages to return, which
                can be `data`, `analysis` or `tool`. Other types of
                notifications may be added in the future. If this parameter
                it not specified then all types of notifications will be
                returned.
            </td>
            <td>Optional</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The `/unseen-messages` endpoint takes only the `user` parameter and returns all
of the notifications that haven't been marked as seen for that user.

Notifications may be marked as seen using the `/seen` endpoint. This endpoint
accepts a JSON request body in the following format:

```json
{
    "uuids": [
        "some-uuid",
        "some-other-uuid",
        ...
    ]
}
```

This endpoint always succeeds as long as no unexpected errors occur. If a UUID
that doesn't correspond to an actual notification is sent to this endpoint, then
the UUID is silently ignored. If a notification that has already been marked as
seen is specified then the notification will not be changed.

Messages that have been marked as seen will no longer be returned by the
`/unseen-messages` endpoint, but will continue to be returned by the `/messages`
endpoint as long as they are not marked as deleted.

Notifications that the user no longer wishes to see may be marked as deleted so
no message query will ever return the message again. Messages are deleted using
the `/delete` endpoint. The `/delete` endpoint takes a JSON request body in the
same format as the `/seen` endpoint.

This service will delete the messages corresponding to all of the identifiers
that are included in the request body. An attempt to delete a message that has
already been marked as deleted is essentially a no-op, and will not cause an
error or warning message. An attempt to delete a message that doesn't exist will
be silently ignored.

## Notification Job Status Tracking

The notification agent keeps track of the status of each job that it sees, which
allows it to detect when the overall status of each job changes. This tracking
is managed by storing records containing only the job identifier and the last
status of the job that was seen by the notification agent in the database.

## Startup Tasks

If there is a configuration problem or the notification agent is down for an
extended period of time then it's possible for the status of a job to be updated
without the notification agent being aware of the change. For this reason, the
notification agent scans the entire OSM upon startup, searching for jobs for
which the current job status doesn't match the status most recently seen by the
notification agent for that job. One notification will be generated for every
job for which an inconsistent state is detected.

## Installation and Configuration

The notification agent is packaged as an RPM and published in iPlant's YUM
repositories. It can be installed using `yum install notificationagent` and
upgraded using `yum upgrade notificationagent`.

### Primary Configuration

The notification agent gets most of its configuration settings from Apache
Zookeeper. These configuration settings are uploaded to Zookeeper using Clavin,
a command-line tool maintained by iPlant that allows configuration properties
and access control lists to be easily uploaded to Zookeeper. Please see the
Clavin documentation for information about how to upload configuration settings.
Here's an example notification agent configuraiton file:

```properties
# Database connection settings.
notificationagent.db.driver      = org.postgresql.Driver
notificationagent.db.subprotocol = postgresql
notificationagent.db.host        = localhost
notificationagent.db.port        = 65001
notificationagent.db.name        = some-db
notificationagent.db.user        = some-user
notificationagent.db.password    = some-password

# OSM configuration settings.
notificationagent.osm-base        = http://localhost:65009
notificationagent.osm-jobs-bucket = jobs

# E-mail configuration settings.
notificationagent.email-url      = http://localhost:65003
notificationagent.enable-email   = true
notificationagent.email-template = analysis_status_change
notificationagent.from-address   = de@iplantcollaborative.org
notificationagent.from-name      = iPlant DE Status Alert

# Notification recipients.
notificationagent.recipients =

# Listen port.
notificationagent.listen-port = 65011
```

The database configuration settings tell the notification agent how to connect
to the relational database that it uses to store notifications, job status
information and email notification records.

The OSM configuration settings tell the notification agent how to connect to the
OSM and which bucket to use. The base URL is fairly self-explanatory. The jobs
bucket is the OSM bucket where the job status information is stored.

The e-mail configuration settings are all fairly self-explanatory except for the
template, which is the name of the template that the e-mail service uses when
generating the message text for job status updates, and the from-address and
from-name fields, which set the from email address and the name associated with
it in the notification email. In general, the template, from-address, and
from-name settings will not change, but they have been made configurable in case
we need to support different templates for different deployments.

The `notificationagent.recipients` setting is a list of URLs to send
notifications to when a job status update is processed. This feature is intended
to be used for server push, so this setting will probably be left blank until
server push is implemented or we find another use for this feature.

The `notificationagent.listen-port` setting contains the port number that the
notification agent should listen to for incoming requests.

### Zookeeper Connection Information

One piece of information that can't be stored in Zookeeper is the information
required to connect to Zookeeper. For the notification agent, this is stored in
a single file: `/etc/iplant-services/zkhosts.properties`. Here's an example:

```properties
zookeeper=by-tor:1234,snow-dog:4321
```

After installing the notification agent, it may be necessary to modify this file
so that it points to the correct host and port.

### Logging Settings

Since logging settings have to be changed fairly frequently for troubleshooting,
logging settings are not stored in Zookeeper. Instead, they're stored in a file
on the local file system in `/etc/notificationagent/log4j.properties'. Since the
notification agent uses log4j, a lot of configuration settings are
available. See the [log4j
documentation](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html). for detailed
information about how to configure logging.

Even though complex logging configuration options are available, they're
normally not necessary because it's possible to exert a lot of control over the
logging behavior by simply tweaking the existing settings. The default logging
configuration file looks like this:

```properties
log4j.rootLogger=WARN, A

log4j.appender.A=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.A.File=/var/log/notificationagent/notificationagent.log
log4j.appender.A.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.A.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{MM-dd@HH:mm:ss} %-5p (%13F:%L) %3x - %m%n
log4j.appender.A.MaxFileSize=10MB
log4j.appender.A.MaxBackupIndex=1
```

The easiest setting to change is the log level. By default, the log level is set
to `WARN`, which is fairly quiet. To obtain a little more information, you can
change the level to `INFO`. If you need even more information then you can set
the level to either `DEBUG` or `TRACE`.

The notification agent also uses a rolling file appender, which prevents the log
files from growing too large. By default, the maximum file size is limited to
ten megabytes and at most one backup log file will be retained. To change the
maximum file size, you can change the `MaxFileSize` parameter. Similarly, you
can change the maximum number of backup log files by altering the
`MaxBackupIndex` parameter.

## Service Details

All service URLs are listed as relative URLs. The welcome endpoint, which can be
used to verify that the notification agent is running and responsive, accepts
GET requests with no query-string parameters.

### Verifying that the Notification Agent is Running

* Endpoint: GET /

The root path in the notification agent can be used to verify that the
notification agent is actually running. Sending a GET request to this service
will result in a welcome message being returned to the caller. Here's an
example:

```
$ curl http://by-tor:65533/
Welcome to the notification agent!
```

### Requesting an Arbitrary Notification

* Endpoint: POST /notification

The purpose of this endpoint is to allow other iPlant services to request
notifications to be sent to the user. The request body for this endpoint is an
abbreviated form of the notification format stored in the OSM.

```json
{
    "type": "some_notification_type",
    "user": "some_user_name",
    "subject": "some subject description",
    "message": "some message text",
    "email": true,
    "email_template": "some_template_name",
    "payload": {
        "email_address": "some@email.address"
    }
}
```

Only the `type`, `user` and `subject` fields are required. The `type` field
contains the notification type, which currently must be known to the UI. The UI
currently knows of three notification types `data`, `analysis` and `tool`. The
`user` field contains the user's unqualified username. (For example, if the full
username is `nobody@iplantcollaborative.org` then the short username is
`nobody`.)  The `subject` field contains a brief description of the event that
prompted the notification. The `message` field contains an optional description
of the event that prompted the notification. If this field is not provided then
its value will default to that of the `subject` field. The `email` field
contains a Boolean flag indicating whether or not an e-mail message should be
sent. The value of this field defaults to `false` if not provided. The
`email_template` field is required if an e-mail is requested, and it must
contain the name of an e-mail template that is known to the iplant-email
service. The payload is optional and may contain arbitrary information that may
be of use to any recipient of the notification. If an e-mail is requested then
this field must contain the user's e-mail address along with any information
required by the selected e-mail template. Here's an example:

```
curl -sd '
{
    "type": "nada",
    "user": "nobody",
    "subject": "nothing happened",
    "message": "nada y pues nada y pues nada",
    "email": true,
    "email_template": "nothing_happened",
    "payload": {
        "email_address": "nobody@iplantcollaborative.org"
    }
}
' http://by-tor:65533/notification | python -mjson.tool
{
    "success": true
}
```

Note that this example is fictional and will not actually send an e-mail message
because the requested e-mail template doesn't exist. The notification type is
also not known to the UI, which will cause errors in the UI.

If the service succeeds, a 200 status code is returned with a simple JSON
response body indicating that the service call succeeded. Otherwise, either a
400 or a 500 status code is returned and a brief description of the problem is
included in the response body.

### Informing the Notification Agent of a Job Status Change

* Endpoint: POST /job-status

This service intended to be used exclusively as an OSM callback for jobs.
Because of this, the request body that is sent to this service must be in the
format that is used to store the job state information in the OSM:

```json
{
    "state": {
        "analysis_description": "Some analysis description",
        "analysis_id": "analysis-identifier",
        "analysis_name": "Some analysis name",
        "completion_date": 1340390297000,
        "condor-log-dir": "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/",
        "dag_id": "directed-acyclic-graph-identifier",
        "description": "",
        "email": "someuser@somewhere.com",
        "execution_target": "execution-target-name",
        "irods_base": "/path/to/base/irods/directory",
        "jobs": {
            "step-name": {
                "arguments": "command-line-arguments",
                "environment": "environment-variable-settings",
                "executable": "/path/to/executable",
                "exit-by-signal": "true-if-process-was-killed",
                "exit-code": "0",
                "id": "step-name",
                "log-file": "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/step-name-log",
                "status": "status-name",
                "stderr": "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/step-name-stderr",
                "stdout": "/path/to/directory/containing/condor/log/files/step-name-stdout"
            },
            ...
        },
        "name": "job-name",
        "nfs_base": "/path/to/nfs/mountpoint/",
        "notify": "true-if-user-wants-notification-emails",
        "now_date": "timestamp-of-most-recent-update",
        "output_dir": "/path/to/job/output/directory/",
        "output_manifest": [
            "list-of-output-files"
        ],
        "request_type": "request-type-name",
        "status": "status-name",
        "submission_date": "submission-date-as-milliseconds-since-the-epoch",
        "type": "some_notification_type",
        "user": "someuser",
        "uuid": "job-identifier",
        "working_dir": "/path/to/job/working/directory/",
        "workspace_id": "numeric-workspace-identifier"
    }
}
```

If the service succeeds, a 200 status code is returned with a simple JSON
response body indicating that the service call succeeded. Otherwise, either a
400 or a 500 status code is returned and a brief description of the problem is
included in the response body.

### Getting Notifications from the Notification Agent

* Endpoint: GET /messages
* Endpoint: GET /unseen-messages

These two endpoints can be used to retrieve notifications from the notification
agent. The former can be used to get both notifications that have already been
seen and notifications that haven't been seen yet. It is very likely that each
user will have a lot of notifications that have already been seen, so the
`/messages` endpoint provides a paginated view, with both the number of messages
and the index of the starting message specified in the query string. The full
list of query string parameters for this endpoint is:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Required/Optional</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>user</td>
            <td>The name of the user to retrieve notifications for.</td>
            <td>Required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>limit</td>
            <td>
                The maximum number of notifications to return at a time or `0`
                if there is no limit.
            </td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `0`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>offset</td>
            <td>The index of the starting message.</td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `0`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>seen</td>
            <td>
                Indicates whether messages that the user has seen, messages that
                the user has not seen, or both should be returned. If the value
                of this parameter is set to `true` then only messages that the
                user has seen will be returned. If the value of this parameter
                is `false` then only messages that the user has not seen will be
                returned. If the this parameter is not specified at all then
                both messages that the user has seen and messages that the user
                has not seen will be returned.
            </td>
            <td>Optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sortField</td>
            <td>
                The field to use when sorting messages. The values that are
                currently accepted for this field are: `date_created`,
                `timestamp` (which is, equivalent to `date_created`), `uuid` and
                `subject`.
            </td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `timestamp`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sortDir</td>
            <td>
                The sorting direction, which can be `asc` (ascending) or `desc`
                (descending).
            </td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `desc`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>filter</td>
            <td>
                Specifies the type of notification messages to return, which
                can be `data`, `analysis`, `tool` or `new`. Other types of
                notifications may be added in the future. If this parameter
                it not specified then all types of notifications will be
                returned. The special filter type, `new`, is provided as a
                convenience for the UI. If this filter is specified then
                unseen notifications of any type will be returned.
            </td>
            <td>Optional</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The `/unseen-messages` endpoint can only be used to obtain messages that haven't
been marked as seen yet. This service does not provide a paginated view because
it is likely that users will want to receive any notifications that they haven't
seen already immediately. This endpoint accepts only the `user` query-string
parameter.

Here are some examples:

```
$ curl -s 'http://by-tor:65533/messages?user=ipctest&limit=1&offset=0' | python -mjson.tool
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "deleted": false,
            "message": {
                "id": "6DF4475F-EE81-4063-B457-6EDFA4ED9C5F",
                "text": "cat_06221137 completed",
                "timestamp": 1340390304000
            },
            "outputDir": "/iplant/home/ipctest/analyses/cat_06221137-2012-06-22-11-37-58.636",
            "outputManifest": [],
            "payload": {
                "action": "job_status_change",
                "analysis_id": "a508674c3c9464ccbbbcf1600650db446",
                "analysis_name": "Concatenate Multiple Files",

}
```

### Getting the Ten Most Recent Notifications

* Endpoint: GET /last-ten-messages

This endpoint takes the username as its only query-string parameter and returns
the ten most recent messages for that username in ascending order by message
timestamp. Obtaining the ten most recent messages in ascending order is
difficult using other endpoints.

this endpoint takes one query-string parameter:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Required/Optional</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>user</td>
            <td>The name of the user to retrieve notifications for.</td>
            <td>Required</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Examples are omitted for this endpoint because the response body is identical to
that of the /messages and /unseen-messages endpoints.

### Counting Notifications

* Endpoint: GET /count-messages

This end-point returns count statistics for the messages that are currently
active. It counts for both system message counts and a user message count. For
the system messages, it returns the total number of messages, the total number
of unseen messages and the total number of new messages. The user messages may
be filtered by a set of criteria. Optional parameters provide this filtering.

This endpoint takes three query-string parameters:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Required/Optional</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>user</td>
            <td>The name of the user to retrieve notifications for.</td>
            <td>Required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>seen</td>
            <td>
                Indicates whether messages that the user has seen, messages that
                the user has not seen, or both should be returned. If the value
                of this parameter is set to `true` then only messages that the
                user has seen will be returned. If the value of this parameter
                is `false` then only messages that the user has not seen will be
                returned. If the this parameter is not specified at all then
                both messages that the user has seen and messages that the user
                has not seen will be returned.
            </td>
            <td>Optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>filter</td>
            <td>
                Specifies the type of notification messages to return, which
                can be `data`, `analysis` or `tool`. Other types of
                notifications may be added in the future. If this parameter
                it not specified then all types of notifications will be
                returned.
            </td>
            <td>Optional</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The response body consists of a JSON object with a four fields:

```json
{
    "user-total":          count,
    "system-total":        count,
    "system-total-new":    count,
    "system-total-unseen": count
}
```

* `user-total` contains the number of user messages that match the criteria specified in the query string.
* `system-total` contains the number of system messages that are active and have not been dismissed by the user.
* `system-total-new` contains the number of system messages that have not been marked as received by the user.
* `system-total-unseen` contains the number of system message that have not been marked as seen by the user.

Here are some examples:

```
$ curl -s "http://by-tor:65533/count-messages?user=ipctest" | python -mjson.tool
{
    "user-total":          409,
    "system-total":         10,
    "system-total-new":      0,
    "system-total-unseen":   1
}
```

In this example, all user messages for the user, `ipctest`, are counted.

```
$ curl -s "http://by-tor:65533/count-messages?user=ipctest&filter=data" | python -mjson.tool
{
    "user-total":          91,
    "system-total":        10,
    "system-total-new":     0,
    "system-total-unseen":  1
}
```

In this example, all data messages for the user, `ipctest`, are counted.

```
$ curl -s "http://by-tor:65533/count-messages?user=ipctest&filter=data&seen=false" | python -mjson.tool
{
    "user-total":           0,
    "system-total":        10,
    "system-total-new":     0,
    "system-total-unseen":  1
}
```

In this example, only unseen data messages for the uer, `ipctest`, are counted.

### Marking Notifications as Seen

* Endpoint: POST /seen

Marking a notification as seen prevents it from being returned by the
`/unseen-messages` endpoint. The intent is for this endpoint to be called when
the user has seen a notification for the first time. This services requires a `user`
query parameter that provides the name of the user who is marking these messages as
seen. This service accepts a request body in the following format:

```json
{
    "uuids": [
        "some-uuid",
        "some-other-uuid",
        ...
    ]
}
```

If this service succeeds, it returns a 200 status code with a simple JSON
response body indicating that the service call suceeded along with the number of
messages that are still marked as unseen. Otherwise, it returns either a 400 or
a 500 status code with a brief description of the error. An attempt to mark a
non-existent message or a message that has already been marked as seen will be
silently ignored.

Here's an example:

```
$ curl -sd '
{
    "uuids": [
        "6DF4475F-EE81-4063-B457-6EDFA4ED9C5F"
    ]
}
' http://by-tor:65533/seen?user=ipctest | python -mjson.tool
{
    "success": true,
    "count": 0
}
```

### Marking All Notifications as Seen

* Endpoint: POST /mark-all-seen

This endpoint allows the client to acknowlege all notifications as seen for a
particular user. This service accepts a request body in a similar format as the
/notification endpoint. The only required JSON field is the "user" field, and
any additional fields will only mark notifications that match those fields as
seen:

```json
{
    "user": "some_user_name",
    ...
}
```

If this service succeeds, it returns a 200 status code with a simple JSON
response body indicating that the service call suceeded along with the number of
messages that are still marked as unseen. Otherwise, it returns either a 400 or
a 500 status code with a brief description of the error. An attempt to mark all
notifications seen for a non-existent user does not cause the service call to
fail. Here's an example:

```
$ curl -sd '
{
    "user": "some_user_name"
}
' http://by-tor:65533/mark-all-seen | python -mjson.tool
{
    "success": true,
    "count": 0
}
```

### Deleting Notifications

* Endpoint: POST /delete

"Deleting" a notification entails marking the notification as deleted in the OSM
so that it won't be returned by either the `/messages` service or the
`/unseen-messages` service. This service accepts a request body in the following
format:

```json
{
    "uuids": [
        "some-uuid",
        "some-other-uuid",
        ...
    ]
}
```

If this service succeeds it returns a 200 status code with a simple JSON
response body indicating that the service call succeeded. Otherwise, it returns
either a 400 status code or a 500 status code with a brief description of the
error. An attempt to delete a message that has already been marked as deleted
does not result in an error. Instead, the service just treats the request as a
no-op. Similarly, an attempt to delete a non-existent message is not treated as
an error. The service also treats this condition as a no-op. Here's an example:

```
$ curl -sd '
{
    "uuids": [
        "361C2A67-3942-4F7A-9734-E5B8B28FDC12"
    ]
}
' http://by-tor:65533/delete?user=ipctest | python -mjson.tool
{
    "success": true
}
```

### Deleting All Notifications

* Endpoint: DELETE /delete-all

This endpoint allows the client to delete all notifications for a particular
user. This service accepts query parameters similar to the fields accepted by
the /notification endpoint. The only required parameter is the "user" parameter,
and any additional parameters will only delete notifications that match those
parameters.

If this service succeeds it returns a 200 status code with a simple JSON
response body indicating that the service call succeeded. Otherwise, it returns
either a 400 status code or a 500 status code with a brief description of the
error. Here's an example:

```
$ curl -X DELETE -s 'http://by-tor:65533/delete-all?user=ipctest' | python -mjson.tool
{
    "success": true,
    "count": "0"
}
```

### Admin - Adding A System Notification

* Endpoint PUT /admin/system

This endpoint allows a client to add a new system notification. There are no query
parameters, only JSON contained in the request body.

This service returns a 200 status code with a JSON response body. Otherwise, it
returns either a 400 or 500 status code with a description of the error.

The HTTP method used for the request should be a PUT. The request body should be
JSON that looks something like the following:


    {
      "type" : "warning",
      "message" : "This is a warning",
      "deactivation_date" : 1340390297000,
      "activation_date" : 1340390297000,
      "dismissible" : false,
      "logins_disabled" : false
    }


The 'type', 'message', and 'deactivation_date' keys are required. The rest are
optional.

The response body for a successful addition will look something like the following:

    {
      "action" : "add-system-notification",
      "success": true,
      "system-notification" : {
        "activation_date": 1340390297000,
        "date_created": 1340390297000,
        "deactivation_date": 1340390297000,
        "dismissible": false,
        "logins_disabled": false,
        "message": "This is a warning",
        "type": "warning",
        "uuid": "140ee541-9967-47cd-ba2b-3b17d8c19dae"
      }
    }

Sample curl:

    curl -X PUT -d '<JSON from the above example>' http://127.0.0.1:31320/admin/system

### Admin - Listing System Notifications

* Endpoint GET /admin/system

This endpoint allows a client to list system notifications that match criteria
specified in the query string. This endpoint currently accepts four query string
parameters:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Required/Optional</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>active-only</td>
            <td>
                If this parameter is specified and set to `true` then only
                system messages that are currently active will be returned by
                the service. Otherwise, all system messages will be returned,
                active or not.
            </td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to `false`)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>
                If this parameter is specified then only system messages of
                the specified type will be returned by the service. The
                `/admin/system-types` endpoint can be used to obtain a list
                of valid system message types. Note that no validation is
                performed on this argument. If an invalid system message type
                is specified then the service will return an empty result set.
            </td>
            <td>Optional (all types of messages are returned by default)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>limit</td>
            <td>
                The maximum number of results to return at a time or 0 if there
                is no limit.
            </td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to 0)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>offset</td>
            <td>The index of the starting message.</td>
            <td>Optional (defaults to 0)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

All query string arguments are optional.

Here's an example of a successful listing:

```
$ curl -s "http://by-tor:65533/admin/system?active-only=true&type=announcement&limit=1" | python -mjson.tool
{
    "action": "admin-list-system-notifications",
